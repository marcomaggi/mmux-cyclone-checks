1. Introduction
---------------

This  package  installs  a  library for  Cyclone  Scheme  a  Scheme-to-C
compiler supporting the  language features as defined  in the 'Revised^7
Report  on Scheme';  the library  implements features  to organise  test
suites and it is derived from SRFI 78 "Lightweight testing".

  The package targets POSIX systems.

  The package uses the GNU Autotools.

  The last time the maintainer cared about updating this paragraph: this
package worked with Cyclone version 0.17.

3. Install
----------

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd mmux-cyclone-checks-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-cyclone-checks

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-cyclone-checks

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  GitHub
site): we must  install the GNU Autotools (GNU  Automake, GNU Autoconf),
then  we must  first run  the script  "autogen.sh" from  the top  source
directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd mmux-cyclone-checks
    $ sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  When compiling the environment  variable CYCLONE_FLAGS is available to
hand options to the compiler:

    $ make CYCLONE_FLAGS='-O3'

  Shared libraries will be installed under "$libdir".


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

   $ make html
   $ make install-html


A. Credits
----------

This package  was written by  Marco Maggi;  if this package  exists it's
because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the time.  SRFI
78 is the  work of Sebastian Egner.  Cyclone is  an original creation of
Justin Ethier.
